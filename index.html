        <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! Well, a little about me.<br>I grew up in small-town New Mexico graduating high school in 2008, college in 2012, and here I am today as an account manager at RetailMeNot!<br>I have always wanted to be creative in my career and coding is the perfect way to be able to put that into my work.
        <br>My interests range from sports to shoes to action figures to video games and I love music. I would also one day love to get into voice acting.</p>
